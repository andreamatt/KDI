It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most. ,Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy. ,To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\\u201d ,AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \\u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children.

Everyone, always, everywhere, we are all responsible. ,Art can do a lot in this sense: it has the power to communicate with everyone, overcoming any barrier; has the strength to transmit strong images that anyone can understand; has the power to force us to reflect because if the narrative occupies relative spaces in the memory of the people, what instead passes through the view remains much more imprinted and is deposited in the conscience, even if unconsciously. More and more people are organizing to protest and raise awareness of society and those who govern us on these issues, on the extreme urgency of a change of course. Simply? We Artists are among those who want to warn of danger. ,What artists are invited to do, therefore, is to shake up and invite them to reflect! HUMAN RIGHTS? by its very nature, it has always had this vocation to positive and proactive provocation, because even in this edition of this we are dealing with: provoking and being proactive at the same time, so as to shake people\\u2019s sensitivity with even intense vibrations, while transmitting at the same time a message and an invitation to \\u201ctogether we can.\\u201dHUMAN RIGHTS? #CLIMA is a complex edition and AIAPI is aware that, as always, the artists know how to surprise with ideas that only creativity and freedom of thought can suggest.

About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of\\u00a0Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by\\u00a0Achillina Granata of Archeogeo,\\u00a0and Cristina Dal R\\u00ec and Nicoletta Pisu of the\\u00a0Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours\\u00a0of the exhibition\\u00a0On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapan\\u00e0 (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director). ,Information ,www.museoaltogarda.it ,www.cultura.trentino.it\\/Temi\\/Archeologiawww.archeosanmartino.it\\u00a0\",\"154\":\"At the MUSE\\u00a0Science museum\\u00a0in Trento the first Italian exhibition by the German sculptor J\\u00fcrgen Lingl-Rebetez.

The exhibition consists of a series of images (more than 3,000 shots) obtained by placing a camera in Madonna di Campiglio, on a terrace overlooking the Brenta Dolomites, with a portion of the view between the Sella mountaintop and the Tosa mountaintop, with view on the Brentei and Bocca di Brenta mountain huts.Terri Maffei Gueret could take these photos with careful and constant presence over a period of 13 month, thanks to the equipment placed on the spot by photographer Luca Chist\\u00e8.From a conceptual point of view, the project relates two distinct temporal scales: the eternal one of nature - from which the title of the exhibition - changeable in appearance, but immutable in substance, and the the limited and ephemeral\\u00a0temporal scale of human experience.The lights, the atmospheres, the colours, the relationship between sky and earth, vary so much that this surprising transformation, diluted in the thousands of images collected, ends up revealing itself, making us reflect on the meaning of things and nature. An extraordinary magic of vision.To accompany the vision of these images, Terri Maffei Gueret has searched for and collected some aphorisms on the topic, as well as some texts from books by great mountaineers.

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most. ,Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy. ,To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\\u201d ,AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \\u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children.

About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of\\u00a0Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by\\u00a0Achillina Granata of Archeogeo,\\u00a0and Cristina Dal R\\u00ec and Nicoletta Pisu of the\\u00a0Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours\\u00a0of the exhibition\\u00a0On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapan\\u00e0 (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director). ,Information ,www.museoaltogarda.it ,www.cultura.trentino.it\\/Temi\\/Archeologiawww.archeosanmartino.it\\u00a0\",\"171\":\"At the MUSE\\u00a0Science museum\\u00a0in Trento the first Italian exhibition by the German sculptor J\\u00fcrgen Lingl-Rebetez.

The exhibition consists of a series of images (more than 3,000 shots) obtained by placing a camera in Madonna di Campiglio, on a terrace overlooking the Brenta Dolomites, with a portion of the view between the Sella mountaintop and the Tosa mountaintop, with view on the Brentei and Bocca di Brenta mountain huts.Terri Maffei Gueret could take these photos with careful and constant presence over a period of 13 month, thanks to the equipment placed on the spot by photographer Luca Chist\\u00e8.From a conceptual point of view, the project relates two distinct temporal scales: the eternal one of nature - from which the title of the exhibition - changeable in appearance, but immutable in substance, and the the limited and ephemeral\\u00a0temporal scale of human experience.The lights, the atmospheres, the colours, the relationship between sky and earth, vary so much that this surprising transformation, diluted in the thousands of images collected, ends up revealing itself, making us reflect on the meaning of things and nature. An extraordinary magic of vision.To accompany the vision of these images, Terri Maffei Gueret has searched for and collected some aphorisms on the topic, as well as some texts from books by great mountaineers.

About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of\\u00a0Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by\\u00a0Achillina Granata of Archeogeo,\\u00a0and Cristina Dal R\\u00ec and Nicoletta Pisu of the\\u00a0Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours\\u00a0of the exhibition\\u00a0On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapan\\u00e0 (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director). ,Information ,www.museoaltogarda.it ,www.cultura.trentino.it\\/Temi\\/Archeologiawww.archeosanmartino.it\\u00a0\",\"190\":\"At the MUSE\\u00a0Science museum\\u00a0in Trento the first Italian exhibition by the German sculptor J\\u00fcrgen Lingl-Rebetez.

The exhibition consists of a series of images (more than 3,000 shots) obtained by placing a camera in Madonna di Campiglio, on a terrace overlooking the Brenta Dolomites, with a portion of the view between the Sella mountaintop and the Tosa mountaintop, with view on the Brentei and Bocca di Brenta mountain huts.Terri Maffei Gueret could take these photos with careful and constant presence over a period of 13 month, thanks to the equipment placed on the spot by photographer Luca Chist\\u00e8.From a conceptual point of view, the project relates two distinct temporal scales: the eternal one of nature - from which the title of the exhibition - changeable in appearance, but immutable in substance, and the the limited and ephemeral\\u00a0temporal scale of human experience.The lights, the atmospheres, the colours, the relationship between sky and earth, vary so much that this surprising transformation, diluted in the thousands of images collected, ends up revealing itself, making us reflect on the meaning of things and nature. An extraordinary magic of vision.To accompany the vision of these images, Terri Maffei Gueret has searched for and collected some aphorisms on the topic, as well as some texts from books by great mountaineers. As a result, the interaction between image and word helps us to reflect even more on the relationship between man and nature.As Henry David Thoreau used to say: 'The perception of beauty is a moral test'.\",\"192\":\"The event refers to artworks by the group 'La Cerchia' of Trento, specially created for the occasion and on the theme of the place.Art exhibition curated by\\u00a0Adriano Fracalossi.Artists: Luisa Bifulco, Carla Caldonazzi, Paolo Dalponte, Bruno Degasperi, Domenico Ferrari, Adriano Fracalossi, Annalisa Lenzi, Silvio Magnini, Gianni Mascotti, Pierluigi Negriolli, Roberto Piazza, Stefania Simeoni, Giorgio Tomasi, Ilario Tomasi, Elisa Zeni.

Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.'Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals' is a collection of\\u00a0large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms.\\u00a0 ,Plankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's. ,Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world. ,Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title. ,Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most. ,Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy. ,To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\\u201d ,AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \\u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children.

More and more people are organizing to protest and raise awareness of society and those who govern us on these issues, on the extreme urgency of a change of course. Simply? We Artists are among those who want to warn of danger. ,What artists are invited to do, therefore, is to shake up and invite them to reflect!

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most. ,Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy. ,To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\\u201d ,AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \\u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children.

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's. ,Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world. ,Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title. ,Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's. ,Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world. ,Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title. ,Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most. ,Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy. ,To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\\u201d ,AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \\u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children.

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most. ,Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy. ,To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\\u201d ,AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \\u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children.

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's. ,Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world. ,Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title. ,Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most. ,Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy. ,To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\\u201d ,AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \\u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children.

Everyone, always, everywhere, we are all responsible. ,Art can do a lot in this sense: it has the power to communicate with everyone, overcoming any barrier; has the strength to transmit strong images that anyone can understand; has the power to force us to reflect because if the narrative occupies relative spaces in the memory of the people, what instead passes through the view remains much more imprinted and is deposited in the conscience, even if unconsciously. More and more people are organizing to protest and raise awareness of society and those who govern us on these issues, on the extreme urgency of a change of course. Simply? We Artists are among those who want to warn of danger. ,What artists are invited to do, therefore, is to shake up and invite them to reflect!

Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.'Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals' is a collection of\\u00a0large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms.\\u00a0 ,Plankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's. ,Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world. ,Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title. ,Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most. ,Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy. ,To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\\u201d ,AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \\u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children.

Everyone, always, everywhere, we are all responsible. ,Art can do a lot in this sense: it has the power to communicate with everyone, overcoming any barrier; has the strength to transmit strong images that anyone can understand; has the power to force us to reflect because if the narrative occupies relative spaces in the memory of the people, what instead passes through the view remains much more imprinted and is deposited in the conscience, even if unconsciously. More and more people are organizing to protest and raise awareness of society and those who govern us on these issues, on the extreme urgency of a change of course. Simply? We Artists are among those who want to warn of danger. ,What artists are invited to do, therefore, is to shake up and invite them to reflect!

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most. ,Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy. ,To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\\u201d ,AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \\u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children.

Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.'Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals' is a collection of\\u00a0large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms.\\u00a0 ,Plankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's. ,Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world. ,Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title. ,Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.'Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals' is a collection of\\u00a0large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms.\\u00a0 ,Plankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's. ,Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world. ,Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title. ,Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'. The book uniquely captures our changing times along with both past and present research.Source:\\u00a0https:\\/\\/www.mandy-barker.com\\/beyond-drifting-alt\",\"403\":\"Gioachino Rossini: Pas de six (Guillaume Tell)Ludwig van Beethoven:\\u00a0Symphony no 8 F-Dur op. 93Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy:\\u00a0\\u00a0Symphony no 4 in A major, op. 90 \\u201cItaliana\\u201d\",\"404\":\"Domus Magna: this is the definition that most frequently appears in ancient documents to refer to the monument, now known as The Palace of the 'Magnifica Comunit\\u00e0 di Fiemme' The exhibition 'La Domus Magna di Cavalese' (The Domus Magna of Cavalese) offers visitors the opportunity to discover the origins and the architectural, functional and decorative evolution of the Palace.

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most. ,Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy. ,To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\\u201d ,AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \\u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children.

The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world. ,Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title. ,Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most. ,Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy. ,To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade.

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most. ,Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy. ,To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\\u201d ,AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \\u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children.

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's. ,Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world. ,Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title. ,Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of\\u00a0Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by\\u00a0Achillina Granata of Archeogeo,\\u00a0and Cristina Dal R\\u00ec and Nicoletta Pisu of the\\u00a0Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours\\u00a0of the exhibition\\u00a0On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapan\\u00e0 (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director). ,Information ,www.museoaltogarda.it ,www.cultura.trentino.it\\/Temi\\/Archeologiawww.archeosanmartino.it\\u00a0\",\"652\":\"At the MUSE\\u00a0Science museum\\u00a0in Trento the first Italian exhibition by the German sculptor J\\u00fcrgen Lingl-Rebetez.

The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world. ,Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title. ,Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern.

Malawi, Mozambico, Togo, Tanzania, Centrafrica e altri Paesi sono narrati in presa diretta anche attraverso le contraddizioni di alcune capitali africane che si muovono verso una veloce \\u201coccidentalizzazione\\u201d e spaccati di vita locale, come la storia di Isaac, bambino di strada in Togo, o l\\u2019incontro con Salimu, ragazzino in cura in un ambulatorio tanzaniano. Le missioni, organizzate per tenere corsi di formazione a personale sanitario locale o per aprire nuovi centri di telemedicina, dipingono un nuovo modo di fare cooperazione che si sta sempre pi\\u00f9 diffondendo negli ultimi anni. \\u00c8 il raccontare come lo slogan \\u201caiutiamoli a casa loro\\u201d viene realizzato in modo quasi naturale da molte realt\\u00e0 di cooperazione internazionale. Ne deriva un libro leggero, divertente, mai superficiale, che aiuta il lettore a guardare all\\u2019Africa e alla globalizzazione con occhi diversi: una chance, non qualcosa da cui difendersi.\\u200b ,Appuntamenti passati ,\\u200b ,mercoled\\u00ec 20 marzo, ore 20.30 ,'Il formicaio intelligente' di Donato Grasso conduce Osvaldo Negra ,Le formiche sono i pi\\u00f9 organizzati tra gli insetti sociali: costruiscono complesse architetture per i loro nidi, reperiscono cibo per la colonia, coltivano funghi in apposite camere del nido, combattono i nemici come un esercito addestrato. Tutto per il bene del formicaio, in assenza di capi a dirigerle. La loro biologia ci ha svelato le basi genetiche dell\\u2019altruismo e ha spiegato come possano emergere comportamenti collettivi complessi anche in assenza di un cervello dominante. Il formicaio intelligente pu\\u00f2 essere messo al nostro servizio. Sono gi\\u00e0 molti i programmi informatici che mimano il comportamento delle colonie di formiche per ottimizzare i flussi di dati in rete o del traffico stradale. Non solo, gli studiosi stanno anche progettando robot ispirati a questi insetti. Impariamo a conoscere chi domina il mondo da oltre 100 milioni di anni. ,mercoled\\u00ec 17 aprile, ore 20.30 ,'La forma delle cose' di Marco Andreatta conduce David Tombolato ,Orientarsi nello spazio, percepire e capire un oggetto attraverso la sua forma, minimizzare gli spostamenti, queste e tante altre abilit\\u00e0 geometriche caratterizzano la quotidianit\\u00e0 del nostro vivere. Platone faceva entrare nell\\u2019Accademia solo chi aveva dimestichezza con la Geometria: una scienza che richiama al tempo stesso questioni filosofiche ma che \\u00e8 anche concreta risposta a tanti quesiti tecnologici. Dalla linea retta agli spazi che si curvano, i teoremi della Geometria ci aiutano da sempre a cercare il facile nel difficile. ,Questo libro \\u00e8 un racconto storico e cognitivo di come la mente umana esplora la forma delle cose e da essa si lascia affascinare; un viaggio che inizia con Euclide e la geometria elementare, per arrivare a Riemann e alle teorie contemporanee, che forniscono alla fisica gli strumenti per capire l\\u2019universo e cercare di formulare una \\u201cTeoria del Tutto\\u201d. ,mercoled\\u00ec 15 maggio, ore 20.30 ,'A mente fredda' di Matteo Cerri conduce Samuela Caliari ,Il consumo energetico \\u00e8 ridotto quasi a zero, il metabolismo rallenta, i neuroni si scollegano, i tumori cessano di crescere: il corpo va in letargo. Orsi, scoiattoli e ghiri sopravvivono cos\\u00ec alla stagione invernale. E noi ci potremmo ibernare? ,Le ricerche degli ultimi 15 anni fanno pensare che sia possibile. I geni necessari a sopravvivere all'ibernazione dovrebbero essere presenti nell'uomo, anche se l'evoluzione ci ha fatto perdere la capacit\\u00e0 di attivare questo stato. La medicina potrebbe trarne grandi benefici: riducendo il bisogno di ossigeno del cervello, avremmo pi\\u00f9 possibilit\\u00e0 di sopravvivere dopo un ictus, un arresto cardiaco o uno shock settico. Anche le agenzie spaziali ne intravedono i vantaggi. Un equipaggio di astronauti ibernati potrebbe, infatti, raggiungere Marte con meno cibo e acqua, evitando anche alterazioni della psiche legate alla lunga permanenza in un ambiente ristretto. Gli astronauti sarebbero anche protetti dai danni delle radiazioni cosmiche, dall'astenia muscolare e dall'osteoporosi che potrebbero insorgere in condizioni di microgravit\\u00e0. ,mercoled\\u00ec 18 settembre, ore 20.15 ,'Informati e vaccinati' di Pierluigi Lopalco conduce Patrizia Fam\\u00e0 ,\\u200b ,La storia della lotta fra l'uomo e i microbi inizia con la nascita delle prime civilt\\u00e0. Una storia avvincente che nel corso del XX secolo subisce un'improvvisa e decisiva svolta proprio grazie alle campagne mondiali di vaccinazione. Il miglioramento delle condizioni igieniche e degli stili di vita, da solo, nulla avrebbe potuto contro flagelli come vaiolo o poliomielite. Oggi, paradossalmente, in tutto il mondo mentre la sanit\\u00e0 pubblica insiste sulla necessit\\u00e0 di promuovere le vaccinazioni, crescono la paura e la diffidenza nei confronti dei vaccini. Questa paura \\u00e8 spesso legata a scarsa conoscenza o disinformazione. Il libro aiuta a capire meglio che cosa sono, come funzionano e quanto sono sicuri i vaccini.

Da quest\\u2019ultimo ambito proviene del resto il pianista Chris Abrahams, associatosi nel sottobosco indipendente di Sidney con il bassista Lloyd Swanton e il batterista Tony Buck.

A musicarlo dal vivo saranno i quotati strumentisti torinesi PAOLO SPACCAMONTI (chitarra e sintetizzatore) e RAMON MORO (tromba e flicorno), gi\\u00e0 in coppia nel 2016 per la colonna sonora de \\u201cI cormorani\\u201d di Fabio Bobbio, insieme alla violoncellista canadese JULIA KENT, anni fa nella formazione dei Johnsons che affiancava Antony Hegarty: artista abituata a sconfinare in ambito cinematografico (un suo brano figurava in \\u201cThis Must Be the Place\\u201d di Paolo Sorrentino), nonch\\u00e9 verso la danza e il teatro. ,Il penultimo appuntamento \\u00e8 in calendario venerd\\u00ec 28 febbraio e vedr\\u00e0 protagonista RICHARD DAWSON, artista del genere che noi chiameremmo cantautore, bench\\u00e9 il suo stile tenda evidentemente altrove.

Era il quinto atto in una serie avviata nel 2007, quando ancora lavorava da commesso in un negozio di dischi di Newcastle e strimpellava una sgangherata chitarra acustica dalle corde di nylon: il prossimo, \\u201c2020\\u201d \\u00e8 atteso in ottobre. ,Transiti si concluder\\u00e0 venerd\\u00ec 27 marzo mettendo in scena una suggestiva osmosi fra musica e immagini: questo offre il progetto chiamato JERUSALEM IN MY HEART, di cui sono responsabili il filmmaker canadese Charles-Andr\\u00e9 Coderre e dal pluristrumentista e cantante di origine libanese Radwan Ghazi Moumneh, contitolare del leggendario studio di registrazione Hotel2Tango. Combinando sonorit\\u00e0 in cui echi della tradizione araba fluttuano in ambienti elettronici a proiezioni di diapositive e video in 16 millimetri, il duo esplora una dimensione audiovisiva dalle qualit\\u00e0 oniriche. Destinato inizialmente alla creazione di performance a soggetto, solo in un secondo tempo il lavoro degli artisti di Montr\\u00e9al \\u00e8 stato cristallizzato su disco, cosa accaduta ancora lo scorso anno con \\u201cDaqa\\u2019iq Tudaik\\u201d, terzo album della serie, edito come i precedenti dall\\u2019influente etichetta locale Constellation. ,Il biglietto d\\u2019ingresso per ciascun appuntamento \\u00e8 in vendita a 10 Euro, con una riduzione a 8 per gli Under 26 e a 5 per gli studenti universitari.\",\"862\":\"Ala, Citt\\u00e0 di Velluto, con il suo mercatino di Natale alternativo, tra suggestione, storia, bellezza e tradizione, racconta e fa rivivere un\\u2019atmosfera d\\u2019altri tempi. ,Aperto il 24-25 novembre, 1-2 dicembre, 8-9 dicembre, 15-16 dicembre, 22-23 dicembre ,Gli androni e le sale di alcuni dei palazzi pi\\u00f9 belli del centro storico ospitano artigiani e artisti con i loro originali manufatti che richiamano la storia, la cultura e le tradizioni di questo magnifico borgo trentino: tessuti, sete, decorazioni natalizie particolari e creative. Un suggestivo ed originale percorso del centro storico che vedr\\u00e0 accolti, nei palazzi settecenteschi, artigiani ed artisti che metteranno in mostra i loro prodotti. Realt\\u00e0 e aziende che mostrano un chiaro legame con il fare, ricreando, all\\u2019interno dei palazzi, delle botteghe narranti capaci di raccontare e comunicare, attraverso laboratori e dimostrazioni, la propria storia e l\\u2019unicit\\u00e0 della propria proposta.\",\"863\":\"Il Mercatino di Natale di Siror, il pi\\u00f9 antico mercatino di Natale del Trentino, come da tradizione si prepara a trasformare l\\u2019antico borgo di Primiero in un romantico Christkindlmarkt. ,Le caratteristiche casette in legno, gli antichi fienili e le stalle del centro storico si trasformeranno in pittoresche botteghe dove trovare originalissimi regali natalizi: decorazioni, presepi, produzioni artigianali e numerose proposte golose, dolci e salate, come il tipico brazedel di Siror, lo zelten trentino, i salumi, il miele, le frittelle e tante altre delizie. ,Durante il Mercatino di Natale scultori da tutta Italia parteciperanno al tradizionale Simposio di Scultura \\u201cArte Natale\\u201d e daranno vita, sotto gli occhi curiosi del pubblico, a piccoli capolavori in legno. Vista la vicinanza alla piste di San Martino di Castrozza-Passo Rolle, che si trovano a solo 13 chilometri, la visita al Mercatino di Natale di Siror diventer\\u00e0 un\\u2019ottima occasione per concludere in bellezza le prime sciate della stagione. ,Quando: 24 novembre \\u2013 1 \\u2013 7 \\u2013 8 \\u2013 15 \\u2013 22 dicembre dalle 10.30 alle 18.30 nel centro storico di Siror (Primiero San Martino di Castrozza)\",\"864\":\"Da sempre palcoscenico per i \\u201cgrandi\\u201d del teatro, anche in questa nuova stagione la Grande Prosa manterr\\u00e0 intatta la propria vocazione, ospitando celebri autori del passato, messi a confronto con autori affermati del teatro contemporaneo, e alcuni tra i volti pi\\u00f9 noti del palcoscenico e del grande schermo come Alessandro Haber, Anna Foglietta, Paolo Calabresi, Sergio Rubini, Luigi Lo Cascio, Elio De Capitani e Natalino Balasso, tra gli altri. Il compito di aprire e chiudere la rassegna spetter\\u00e0 per\\u00f2 a due progetti fortemente legati alla territorialit\\u00e0 trentina, che vedranno coinvolti l\\u2019attore Andrea Castelli (in chiusura di Stagione, al Teatro Cuminetti) e la compagnia trentina OHT | Office for a Human Theatre. Quest\\u2019ultima, in particolare, esordir\\u00e0 con un progetto dedicato alla tragedia che nel 1985 ha colpito la Val di Stava e l\\u2019intera comunit\\u00e0 trentina. Ma una ulteriore novit\\u00e0 caratterizzer\\u00e0 la nuova Stagione: \\u00ab19 LUGLIO 1985\\u00bb, questo il titolo del progetto incentrato sulla catastrofe avvenuta in Val di Fiemme \\u2013 che sar\\u00e0 accompagnato da una mostra allestita presso lo Spazio Archeologico del SAS - sar\\u00e0 infatti lo spettacolo che inaugurer\\u00e0 anche la rassegna rivolta alle opere pi\\u00f9 sperimentali e alternative della scena nazionale. ,Entrambe le stagioni Grande Prosa e Altre Tendenze incominceranno quindi con il medesimo spettacolo al Teatro Sociale (e non pi\\u00f9 al \\u201cCuminetti\\u201d), a sottolineare il legame tra le diverse forme e possibilit\\u00e0 del teatro e la capacit\\u00e0 della scena di farsi luogo di riflessione dei grandi temi del contemporaneo. ,\\u201c19 LUGLIO 1985\\u201d \\u00e8 una produzione originale di OHT, in coproduzione con il Centro Santa Chiara e Roma Europa Festival, e con la collaborazione di Centrale Fies e la Fondazione Stava 1985. A quasi 35 anni dalla colata di fango che cancell\\u00f2 una valle e, con essa, centinaia di vite umane, Filippo Andreatta con il supporto drammaturgico di Marco Bernardi guarda a quell\\u2019episodio come momento epifanico del rapporto uomo - montagna e lo celebra in una \\u201ctragedia alpina\\u201d. Sullo sfondo dei paesaggi della Val di Stava, il Coro Continuum diretto dal Maestro Luigi Azzolini accompagner\\u00e0 la narrazione con un prezioso commento musicale. La proposta della Grande Prosa prosegue con un grande classico del teatro francese. In \\u201cLA SCUOLA DELLE MOGLI\\u201d , il napoletano Arturo Cirillo rilegge la commedia di Moli\\u00e8re (in chiave moderna), raccontando la storia di come l\\u2019amore sia la sola chiave della felicit\\u00e0 umana. Dicembre sar\\u00e0 il turno della commedia italiana con una produzione del Teatro Stabile di Bolzano, con in scena l\\u2019amatissimo Natalino Balasso per la regia di Serena Sinigaglia e la riscrittura drammaturgia di Vitaliano Trevisan. \\u201cLA BANCAROTTA\\u201d , testo poco conosciuto di Goldoni, fotografa con ironia il personaggio di un imprenditore sull\\u2019orlo del fallimento e dei vizi che l\\u2019hanno portato a dissipare denaro e relazioni personali. Il 2020 inizier\\u00e0 con il ritorno della coppia Luigi Lo Cascio - Sergio Rubini che dopo il successo di \\u201cDelitto e Castigo\\u201d scandaglieranno le oscurit\\u00e0 del mondo attraverso un altro capolavoro della letteratura: \\u201cDRACULA\\u201d di Bram Stoker. Dai grandi classici alle nuove scritture di scena, \\u201cLA CLASSE\\u201d di Vincenzo Manna tratteggia il ritratto di un gruppo di studenti di un istituto professionale e di un professore di storia disposto a tutto pur di educare i suoi ragazzi alla difficile sfida della societ\\u00e0 multiculturale. La stagione prosegue con Anna Foglietta e Paolo Calabresi, interpreti di \\u201cBELLA FIGURA\\u201d, surreale commedia della francese Yasmine Reza che prende il via dalla gelosia di un\\u2019amante nei confronti della moglie. Grandi nomi anche per \\u201cLIBRI DA ARDERE\\u201d , unico testo teatrale di Am\\u00e8lie Nothomb messo in scena dal Teatro dell\\u2019Elfo e dalla Corte Ospitale, con Elio De Capitani accompagnato da Angelo Di Genio e Carolina Cametti. Stretti nella morsa della neve in una citt\\u00e0 dell\\u2019est Europa, un professore e due giovani devono scegliere tra morire di freddo o bruciare dei libri, combattuti tra lo spirito di sopravvivenza e il rispetto per i simboli cartacei della conoscenza umana. Alessandro Haber guidato dalla regia di Leo Muscato sar\\u00e0 il protagonista di \\u201cMORTE DI UN COMMESSO VIAGGIATORE\\u201d , capolavoro di Arthur Miller prodotto dal Teatro Stabile di Bolzano, Goldenart e dal Teatro Stabile del Veneto. La storia del lavoratore attratto dal facile guadagno e dal miraggio del successo che continua a risuonare fortemente nella nostra contemporaneit\\u00e0. Proseguendo nel filone letterario sar\\u00e0 poi il turno di \\u201cLO STRANO CASO DEL CANE UCCISO A MEZZANOTTE\\u201d , coproduzione del Teatro dell\\u2019Elfo e del Teatro Stabile di Torino tratto dal celebre romanzo di Mark Haddon. Il giovane Christopher, affetto dalla sindrome di Asperger, si trover\\u00e0 a indagare sull\\u2019uccisione del cane della sua vicina, aprendo un\\u2019emozionante finestra sulla vita di chi vede il mondo in maniera un po\\u2019 diversa. A chiudere la programmazione Andrea Castelli, nome pi\\u00f9 che amato in tutta la regione e oltre, accompagnato dalle musiche live di Emanuele Dell\\u2019Aquila, guider\\u00e0 il suo pubblico in un viaggio della memoria con \\u201cLA MERAVIGLIA. Voci e storie della citt\\u00e0 sotterranea\\u201d . Una produzione del Teatro Stabile di Bolzano che guarda al passato senza amara nostalgia, ma con il gusto di guardarsi indietro e riconoscersi accomunati dalle stesse storie. ,Citando una vecchia pubblicit\\u00e0 di Carosello, l\\u2019indimenticato Ernesto Calindri \\u2013 storica figura del teatro italiano \\u2013 sosteneva che contro il logorio della vita moderna fosse sufficiente ricorrere ad un superalcolico al carciofo. La nuova Stagione del Centro Servizi Culturali S. Chiara, invece, per tentare di far fronte alle difficolt\\u00e0 e alle contraddizioni del contemporaneo, propone al proprio pubblico un potente rimedio: il teatro, mai come in questo momento specchio che riflette le contraddizioni dell\\u2019oggi, aprendo gli occhi al loro auspicabile superamento. ,Anche la stagione Altre Tendenze, dopo essere iniziata con lo spettacolo dedicato alla tragedia di Stava, prosegue con titoli di grande richiamo che attraversano pi\\u00f9 di duemila anni di storia del teatro. A calcare per prima il palco del Teatro Sociale sar\\u00e0 la compagnia veneta Anagoor con il grandioso affresco classico \\u201cORESTEA\\u201d , tratto dalla trilogia di Eschilo con la regia di Simone Derai. Coprodotto da Centrale Fies, il trittico racconta la vicenda degli Atridi e la scia di sangue scatenata dalla Guerra di Troia, mescolando l\\u2019epica antica con i moderni riti funebri. A seguire, il grande teatro di narrazione di Marco Baliani con \\u201cUNA NOTTE SBAGLIATA\\u201d accompagner\\u00e0 il pubblico di Trento in un emozionante viaggio nella coscienza umana. Il caso di cronaca di un senzatetto picchiato da alcuni poliziotti e la violenza di cui lo stesso Baliani \\u00e8 stato testimone diventano occasione per riflettere sulle zone oscure dell\\u2019uomo. Ugualmente profondo, ma irresistibilmente ironico e pungente, \\u201cOVERLOAD\\u201d dei Sotterraneo \\u00e8 uno spettacolo interattivo che si diverte a mettere alla prova l\\u2019attenzione del pubblico, vincitore del Premio Ubu come migliore spettacolo del 2018. L\\u2019anno nuovo inizia con alcune giovani compagnie italiane particolarmente amate da pubblico e critica. In \\u201cCUORE DI CANE\\u201d , la barese Licia Lanera si ispira alla cupa storia del russo Michail Bulgakov per portare sul palco dell\\u2019Auditorium Melotti di Rovereto il mito della bellezza e dell\\u2019eterna giovinezza, grandi ossessioni della societ\\u00e0 contemporanea. A febbraio sar\\u00e0 invece Stefano Cordella, alla guida della compagnia Oyes, a emozionare il pubblico di Trento e Rovereto. \\u201cIO NON SONO UN GABBIANO\\u201d secondo capitolo del dittico cechoviano, rilegge il grande classico del maestro del teatro russo per scoprire quanto ancora di vero c\\u2019\\u00e8 nell\\u2019urlo di ribellione dei figli nei confronti dei padri. Tra i due spettacoli, la figura di un grande maestro del teatro contemporaneo. \\u201cTHE NIGHT WRITER\\u201d \\u00e8 un viaggio intimo e prezioso nella vita di Jan Fabre, artista fiammingo tra i grandi protagonisti della scena internazionale. A dare corpo alle parole di Fabre il giovane talento italiano Lino Musella. La stagione proseguir\\u00e0 con Alessandro Bergonzoni e il suo ultimo lavoro \\u201cTRASCENDI E SALI\\u201d . Nel pi\\u00f9 puro stile bergonzoniano, tra comicit\\u00e0 e rigore, l\\u2019artista bolognese invita il pubblico a seguirlo in una tagliente riflessione sul presente. Dalla surrealt\\u00e0 al risorgimento, \\u201cV\\u00c1 PENSIERO\\u201d del Teatro delle Albe accompagna il pubblico del Teatro Sociale alla scoperta di una storia vera in grado di farsi parabola dei nostri tempi. In Emilia Romagna un poliziotto viene licenziato perch\\u00e9 ha denunciato alcuni atti illeciti legati alla mafia. Ermanna Montanari e Marco Martinelli, con il Coro da Camera del Conservatorio di Trento, si ispirano alla musica di Giuseppe Verdi per parlare di democrazia, giustizia e speranza. A chiudere la stagione Altre Tendenze, la nuova produzione della compagnia teatrale trentina Emit Flesti \\u201cJACQUES E IL SUO PADRONE\\u201d . Unica opera teatrale di Milan Kundera, la commedia \\u00e8 un esplicito omaggio a Denis Diderot e vede protagonisti un nobile francese e il suo valletto che discutono di amore tra avventure, tradimenti e scherzi, celebrando quell\\u2019allegria che pu\\u00f2 salvare dal buio della storia. ,Per quanto riguarda la proposta di abbonamento alla Grande Prosa, i prezzi previsti per la nuova Stagione oscillano tra 40 e 175 Euro, con la consueta vantaggiosa proposta \\u201csu misura\\u201d per il sabato sera (da 35 a 160 euro).

Questa vicenda offre uno spunto per interrogarsi su un cambiamento epocale a partire da un punto di osservazione che privilegia le storie private e familiari, restituendole attraverso un duplice racconto: fotografico e video. ,La semplice domanda \\u00abRicordi come hai speso il tuo Begr\\u00fcssungsgeld?\\u00bb posta a un campione di tedeschi della ex DDR di generazioni differenti, intervistati nel corso del 2018 e 2019, ha rappresentato il punto di partenza per un viaggio nella memoria, oggi ancora poco condivisa, di queste persone che hanno vissuto un cambiamento totale, sia da un punto di vista materiale, lavorativo, sociale ed economico, sia politico. ,Se la caduta del muro di Berlino ha posto le basi per un nuovo assetto politico e geografico mondiale segnando la fine della Guerra Fredda, la riunificazione tra Germania Est e Germania Ovest rimane ancora oggi un fenomeno complesso e poco discusso nei suoi aspetti pi\\u00f9 profondi. Spesso risolto in modo semplicistico come il coronamento di uno scontato desiderio di libert\\u00e0, il superamento del confine fisico che simbolicamente coincide con l\\u2019abbattimento del muro porta inevitabilmente con s\\u00e9 la necessit\\u00e0 di superare anche un confine ideologico. ,Il 9 novembre 1989 non cade soltanto il muro di Berlino ma cambia un intero paese: la parte che si ricongiunge alle sue origini subisce una inevitabile metamorfosi e svaniscono rapidamente un modo di vivere, di pensare, di comportarsi, di vestire, di spendere. In tempi brevissimi la Repubblica Democratica Tedesca \\u00e8 rimossa dall'immaginario e dalla memoria. Quasi 17 milioni di persone si trovano di colpo immerse in un nuovo stile di vita, dove non valgono pi\\u00f9 le regole apprese fino ad allora. La trasformazione \\u00e8 repentina.

Spesso risolto in modo semplicistico come il coronamento di uno scontato desiderio di libert\\u00e0, il superamento del confine fisico che simbolicamente coincide con l\\u2019abbattimento del muro porta inevitabilmente con s\\u00e9 la necessit\\u00e0 di superare anche un confine ideologico. ,Il 9 novembre 1989 non cade soltanto il muro di Berlino ma cambia un intero paese: la parte che si ricongiunge alle sue origini subisce una inevitabile metamorfosi e svaniscono rapidamente un modo di vivere, di pensare, di comportarsi, di vestire, di spendere. In tempi brevissimi la Repubblica Democratica Tedesca \\u00e8 rimossa dall'immaginario e dalla memoria. Quasi 17 milioni di persone si trovano di colpo immerse in un nuovo stile di vita, dove non valgono pi\\u00f9 le regole apprese fino ad allora. La trasformazione \\u00e8 repentina. Nelle politiche governative e nella vita quotidiana delle persone si afferma il nuovo alfabeto dell'Ovest, i suoi colori, i suoi odori, le sue politiche economiche e sociali, e quelle che erano due comunit\\u00e0 distinte si trovano a convivere. ,Il racconto fotografico di Tommaso Bonaventura, intrecciandosi alla narrazione di queste biografie, si propone di restituire una Berlino contemporanea fatta di volti, luoghi e storie non scontati, rimasta simbolo di uno degli eventi pi\\u00f9 significativi della storia recente, ancora viva e presente nel tessuto cittadino, urbano e sociale. La ricerca si \\u00e8 infatti focalizzata su Berlino quale emblema di questo cambiamento, ma anche citt\\u00e0 in cui la presenza fisica e 'mentale' del muro, che ha segnato cos\\u00ec fortemente l'esperienza delle persone, in qualche modo permane.\",\"1007\":\"Aperitivo InDanza ,Performance di danza, installazioni e bollicine al museo ,Periodo ,15\\/11\\/2019 - 01\\/03\\/2020 ,Localit\\u00e0 ,Rovereto ,Tipologia ,Teatro\\/Danza, Spettacoli, Enogastronomia ,In occasione degli spettacoli della rassegna inDanza presso l'Auditorium Melotti, il Mart collabora con il Centro Servizi Culturali S.

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most. ,Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy. ,To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\\u201d ,AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \\u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children.

More and more people are organizing to protest and raise awareness of society and those who govern us on these issues, on the extreme urgency of a change of course. Simply? We Artists are among those who want to warn of danger. ,What artists are invited to do, therefore, is to shake up and invite them to reflect!

About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of\\u00a0Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by\\u00a0Achillina Granata of Archeogeo,\\u00a0and Cristina Dal R\\u00ec and Nicoletta Pisu of the\\u00a0Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours\\u00a0of the exhibition\\u00a0On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapan\\u00e0 (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director). ,Information ,www.museoaltogarda.it ,www.cultura.trentino.it\\/Temi\\/Archeologiawww.archeosanmartino.it\\u00a0\",\"154\":\"At the MUSE\\u00a0Science museum\\u00a0in Trento the first Italian exhibition by the German sculptor J\\u00fcrgen Lingl-Rebetez.

The exhibition consists of a series of images (more than 3,000 shots) obtained by placing a camera in Madonna di Campiglio, on a terrace overlooking the Brenta Dolomites, with a portion of the view between the Sella mountaintop and the Tosa mountaintop, with view on the Brentei and Bocca di Brenta mountain huts.Terri Maffei Gueret could take these photos with careful and constant presence over a period of 13 month, thanks to the equipment placed on the spot by photographer Luca Chist\\u00e8.From a conceptual point of view, the project relates two distinct temporal scales: the eternal one of nature - from which the title of the exhibition - changeable in appearance, but immutable in substance, and the the limited and ephemeral\\u00a0temporal scale of human experience.The lights, the atmospheres, the colours, the relationship between sky and earth, vary so much that this surprising transformation, diluted in the thousands of images collected, ends up revealing itself, making us reflect on the meaning of things and nature. An extraordinary magic of vision.To accompany the vision of these images, Terri Maffei Gueret has searched for and collected some aphorisms on the topic, as well as some texts from books by great mountaineers. As a result, the interaction between image and word helps us to reflect even more on the relationship between man and nature.As Henry David Thoreau used to say: 'The perception of beauty is a moral test'.\",\"156\":\"The event refers to artworks by the group 'La Cerchia' of Trento, specially created for the occasion and on the theme of the place.Art exhibition curated by\\u00a0Adriano Fracalossi.Artists: Luisa Bifulco, Carla Caldonazzi, Paolo Dalponte, Bruno Degasperi, Domenico Ferrari, Adriano Fracalossi, Annalisa Lenzi, Silvio Magnini, Gianni Mascotti, Pierluigi Negriolli, Roberto Piazza, Stefania Simeoni, Giorgio Tomasi, Ilario Tomasi, Elisa Zeni.

About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of\\u00a0Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by\\u00a0Achillina Granata of Archeogeo,\\u00a0and Cristina Dal R\\u00ec and Nicoletta Pisu of the\\u00a0Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours\\u00a0of the exhibition\\u00a0On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapan\\u00e0 (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director). ,Information ,www.museoaltogarda.it ,www.cultura.trentino.it\\/Temi\\/Archeologiawww.archeosanmartino.it\\u00a0\",\"171\":\"At the MUSE\\u00a0Science museum\\u00a0in Trento the first Italian exhibition by the German sculptor J\\u00fcrgen Lingl-Rebetez.

The exhibition consists of a series of images (more than 3,000 shots) obtained by placing a camera in Madonna di Campiglio, on a terrace overlooking the Brenta Dolomites, with a portion of the view between the Sella mountaintop and the Tosa mountaintop, with view on the Brentei and Bocca di Brenta mountain huts.Terri Maffei Gueret could take these photos with careful and constant presence over a period of 13 month, thanks to the equipment placed on the spot by photographer Luca Chist\\u00e8.From a conceptual point of view, the project relates two distinct temporal scales: the eternal one of nature - from which the title of the exhibition - changeable in appearance, but immutable in substance, and the the limited and ephemeral\\u00a0temporal scale of human experience.The lights, the atmospheres, the colours, the relationship between sky and earth, vary so much that this surprising transformation, diluted in the thousands of images collected, ends up revealing itself, making us reflect on the meaning of things and nature. An extraordinary magic of vision.To accompany the vision of these images, Terri Maffei Gueret has searched for and collected some aphorisms on the topic, as well as some texts from books by great mountaineers. As a result, the interaction between image and word helps us to reflect even more on the relationship between man and nature.As Henry David Thoreau used to say: 'The perception of beauty is a moral test'.\",\"173\":\"The event refers to artworks by the group 'La Cerchia' of Trento, specially created for the occasion and on the theme of the place.Art exhibition curated by\\u00a0Adriano Fracalossi.Artists: Luisa Bifulco, Carla Caldonazzi, Paolo Dalponte, Bruno Degasperi, Domenico Ferrari, Adriano Fracalossi, Annalisa Lenzi, Silvio Magnini, Gianni Mascotti, Pierluigi Negriolli, Roberto Piazza, Stefania Simeoni, Giorgio Tomasi, Ilario Tomasi, Elisa Zeni.

The exhibition consists of a series of images (more than 3,000 shots) obtained by placing a camera in Madonna di Campiglio, on a terrace overlooking the Brenta Dolomites, with a portion of the view between the Sella mountaintop and the Tosa mountaintop, with view on the Brentei and Bocca di Brenta mountain huts.Terri Maffei Gueret could take these photos with careful and constant presence over a period of 13 month, thanks to the equipment placed on the spot by photographer Luca Chist\\u00e8.From a conceptual point of view, the project relates two distinct temporal scales: the eternal one of nature - from which the title of the exhibition - changeable in appearance, but immutable in substance, and the the limited and ephemeral\\u00a0temporal scale of human experience.The lights, the atmospheres, the colours, the relationship between sky and earth, vary so much that this surprising transformation, diluted in the thousands of images collected, ends up revealing itself, making us reflect on the meaning of things and nature. An extraordinary magic of vision.To accompany the vision of these images, Terri Maffei Gueret has searched for and collected some aphorisms on the topic, as well as some texts from books by great mountaineers.

Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.'Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals' is a collection of\\u00a0large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms.\\u00a0 ,Plankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's. ,Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world. ,Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title. ,Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most. ,Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy. ,To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\\u201d ,AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \\u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children.

More and more people are organizing to protest and raise awareness of society and those who govern us on these issues, on the extreme urgency of a change of course. Simply?

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most. ,Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy. ,To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\\u201d ,AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \\u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children.

Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.'Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals' is a collection of\\u00a0large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms.\\u00a0 ,Plankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's. ,Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world. ,Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title. ,Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's. ,Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world. ,Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title. ,Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most. ,Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy. ,To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\\u201d ,AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \\u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children.

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most. ,Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy. ,To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\\u201d ,AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \\u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children.

Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.'Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals' is a collection of\\u00a0large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms.\\u00a0 ,Plankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's. ,Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world. ,Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title. ,Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most. ,Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy. ,To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\\u201d ,AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \\u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children.

More and more people are organizing to protest and raise awareness of society and those who govern us on these issues, on the extreme urgency of a change of course. Simply?

Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.'Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals' is a collection of\\u00a0large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms.\\u00a0 ,Plankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's. ,Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world. ,Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title. ,Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most. ,Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy. ,To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\\u201d ,AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \\u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children.

More and more people are organizing to protest and raise awareness of society and those who govern us on these issues, on the extreme urgency of a change of course. Simply? We Artists are among those who want to warn of danger. ,What artists are invited to do, therefore, is to shake up and invite them to reflect!

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most. ,Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy. ,To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\\u201d ,AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \\u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children.

Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.'Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals' is a collection of\\u00a0large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms.\\u00a0 ,Plankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's. ,Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world. ,Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title. ,Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.'Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals' is a collection of\\u00a0large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms.\\u00a0 ,Plankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's. ,Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world. ,Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title. ,Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'. The book uniquely captures our changing times along with both past and present research.Source:\\u00a0https:\\/\\/www.mandy-barker.com\\/beyond-drifting-alt\",\"403\":\"Gioachino Rossini: Pas de six (Guillaume Tell)Ludwig van Beethoven:\\u00a0Symphony no 8 F-Dur op. 93Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy:\\u00a0\\u00a0Symphony no 4 in A major, op. 90 \\u201cItaliana\\u201d\",\"404\":\"Domus Magna: this is the definition that most frequently appears in ancient documents to refer to the monument, now known as The Palace of the 'Magnifica Comunit\\u00e0 di Fiemme' The exhibition 'La Domus Magna di Cavalese' (The Domus Magna of Cavalese) offers visitors the opportunity to discover the origins and the architectural, functional and decorative evolution of the Palace.

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most. ,Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy. ,To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\\u201d ,AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \\u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children.

The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world. ,Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title. ,Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most. ,Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy. ,To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade.

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most. ,Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy. ,To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\\u201d ,AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \\u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children.

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's. ,Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world. ,Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title. ,Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of\\u00a0Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by\\u00a0Achillina Granata of Archeogeo,\\u00a0and Cristina Dal R\\u00ec and Nicoletta Pisu of the\\u00a0Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours\\u00a0of the exhibition\\u00a0On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapan\\u00e0 (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director). ,Information ,www.museoaltogarda.it ,www.cultura.trentino.it\\/Temi\\/Archeologiawww.archeosanmartino.it\\u00a0\",\"652\":\"At the MUSE\\u00a0Science museum\\u00a0in Trento the first Italian exhibition by the German sculptor J\\u00fcrgen Lingl-Rebetez.

The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world. ,Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title. ,Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern.
